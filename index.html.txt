          <p>
            Organizations are asking leaders to move faster, adapt to AI, and carry more responsibility during seasons of uncertainty and transformation.
            Burnout, disengagement, and quiet attrition are rising, especially among experienced women navigating midlife transitions, menopause,
            and shifts in identity and value.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many leaders are expected to adopt AI and lead change without clarity, language, or support for the human impact.
            This is not a performance issue. It is a capacity issue.
